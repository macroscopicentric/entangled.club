# Entangled Club Social Contract

_Note: This is a WIP! If you are part of [Entangled Club](https://entangled.club/) and you'd like to propose edits to this doc, please post them on the server and tag them #meta. If we like them (or at least if there are no complaints) we'll add them here. The goal is to build a community together. <3_

_Importantly, this is **not** the same as the [Code of Conduct](https://entangled.club/code-of-conduct). The CoC is table stakes, and violations mean you're out. This is more wiggly! We might edit it periodically, and also you're not gonna get kicked out if you don't adhere to it. But like, we also want this to be a place where everyone agrees on the kind of place we want it to be, so if you've got a problem with something in here, let's change or talk about it, and build a set of norms we all like._

1. **No [anti-fandoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-fan).** This includes, but is not limited to: Republicans, cars, men. You can dislike 'em all you want (that's fair), we just don't make a hobby out of disliking them, ya know? We also firmly believe that misandry is a pipeline to TERFdom and we're not about that.

2. **This is not a politics-free environment.** Politics happens. 🙃 And it frequently happens to us, or if we're lucky we happy to politics. But it's a part of our lives and this is not an escapist place where we avoid talking about it. (But, like, maybe put it behind a content warning for #uspol if you think that would be nice, too.)

3. **Conflict is okay.** Conflict also happens! We're committed to working through our own conflicts (maybe on our own, maybe if you want the group involved). Rachel is the moderator but that means she's only responsible for really serious Code of Conduct violations. Everything else up to CoC violations is expected to be handled by the participants.

4. **[No feigning surprise and no well-actuallys.](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules)** It's okay to not know things! It's not okay to shame people or even make them feel embarrassed for not knowing things.

5. **Kindness is key.** We're here because we _like_ hanging out with each other. I'm not gonna say "assume best intent" because that's not always true and has become a bullshit handwavey phrase, but we don't do put-downs of any kind and we cheer each other on through good and hard stuff.
